# Enhanced Speech-to-Text for Flutter

Welcome to the Enhanced Speech-to-Text library for Flutter! This library extends the functionality of the native `speech_to_text` package to address common issues such as:

1. **Continuous Listening**: Supports uninterrupted listening sessions.
2. **Error Management**: Reduces instances of unexpected stops and improves error handling.
3. **State Management**: Ensures better state management for smoother performance.
4. **Consistent Stopping Mechanism**: Provides a reliable stopping mechanism during user interactions.

This library integrates seamlessly with Provider and SharedPreferences for state management and persistence.

## Features

- **Continuous Listening**: Keeps listening actively until explicitly stopped.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully without interrupting the user experience.
- **Enhanced State Management**: Utilizes Provider for effective state management.
- **Consistent User Interaction**: Ensures proper stopping and starting of the listening process.
